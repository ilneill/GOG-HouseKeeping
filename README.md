## GOG Archive House-keeping Script

I like to keep a local copy of all my GOG games. However as GOG continually updates them my archive just fills up with lots of older versions.

This script allows me to scan, analyse and catalogue my archive. It easily spots folders with multiple windows or linux installers, allowing me to go in there and purge older versions.

### Why?
The GOG downloader just keeps puting new or updated files into the correct folder. No overwritting, just continual adding.

Over time the amount of disc space consumed by old installers can be huge!

### Is it useful?
Yes. I use it once a quarter, or whenever my NAS drive is getting a bit too full!

### Running
GOG-HouseKeeping is a python script. Run from the command line or via IDLE.

### Missing and ToDo
Nothing... unless something is spotted.
